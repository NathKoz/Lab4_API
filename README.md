# Lab4_API
Utilizing an online API that returns something and I make updates to.


## Issues

- I didn't know how to display the data/graphics I wanted to from the Metaweather API

- I hadn't used the Metaweather API before, so I had to learn how to use it and accurately call from it

- Metaweather API wasn't returning, so I changed the API I was using.

- PokeAPI is simple, so I need to make something that is more complex than just a simple API call and fetch.

- Rendering a sprite is sort of difficult when different systems have different img viewers, so had to figure out how to use the default viewer of a system.

- Made a simple text based menu that the user can narrow down their search of the PokeAPI, but had to change the default language to English because of the default language being German.
