# Lab4_API
Utilizing an online API that returns something and I make updates to.


## Issues

- I didn't know how to display the data/graphics I wanted to from the Metaweather API

- I hadn't used the Metaweather API before, so I had to learn how to use it and accurately call from it

- Metaweather API wasn't returning, so I changed the API I was using.

- PokeAPI is simple, so I need to make something that is more complex than just a simple API call and fetch.
